# NuGet API Introduction

There are a variety of ways to interact with NuGet programmatically.

## Consuming and publishing packages

To interact with packages available on NuGet.org and other V3-enabled NuGet package sources such as MyGet and Visual
Studio Team Services package management, you can either:

1. Use the <a href="v3/overview.md">HTTP-based V3 API</a> and write your own client code.
1. Use the <a href="nuget-client-sdk.md">NuGet client SDK</a>, a set of .NET libraries used by the official NuGet clients.

## Extending authentication

NuGet supports extensions on how users authenticate with packages sources via **credential providers**. There are two
forms of credential providers each used by a different client experience.

1. <a href="NuGet-Credential-Providers-for-Visual-Studio.md">Credential providers for Visual Studio</a>.
1. <a href="nuget-exe-Credential-Providers.md">Credential providers for nuget.exe</a>.
